# 🧠 Vitamin Deficiency Detection Using Machine Learning

A computer vision–based ML project to detect vitamin deficiencies from facial images — combining healthcare and AI for faster, smarter diagnostics.

---

## 📸 What It Does

This project uses machine learning and image processing to **predict vitamin deficiencies** through facial feature analysis.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 **Image Processing with OpenCV**  
  Preprocessing, edge detection, and color space transformation for feature extraction.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model Training**  
  Fine-tuned classifiers to achieve high prediction accuracy (SVM, Random Forest, or CNN — depending on your model).

- ⚙️ **Optimized Dataset Handling**  
  Cleaned and normalized real-world datasets for performance and reliability.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- `Python`
- `OpenCV`
- `CNN`
- `scikit-learn`
- `NumPy`, `Pandas`
- `TensorFlow`

---

## 🏥 Use Case

Vitamin deficiency symptoms often show up subtly on the face (dry lips, pale skin, hair loss). This tool can assist in:

- Early screening and detection  
- Medical research and automation  
- Low-resource healthcare settings
